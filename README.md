# ðŸš¨ Threat Hunt Investigation: Data Exfiltration By Disgruntled Employee 

**Author:** James Moore  \
**Date:** April 13, 2025  \
**Lab Type:** Threat Hunting / Data Exfiltration / MITRE ATT&CK Mapping  \

---

## :bookmark_tabs: Overview
This lab simulates a real-world threat hunting scenario involving a disgruntled employee suspected of malicious insider behavior. After being placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP), the employee was subsequently terminated. Concerns were raised that they may have attempted to steal proprietary company data from their corporate-assigned endpoint. This investigation uses Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) telemetry, KQL queries, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping to uncover potential data exfiltration activities involving unauthorized file archiving and suspicious PowerShell execution.

## :world_map: Incident Summary
The VM `win10vm` showed repeated ZIP file creation and manipulation activity. Further investigation revealed the use of `7z.exe` to compress data and `powershell.exe` to rename and move files into a hidden backup folderâ€”signs of possible data staging.

## :mag_right: Investigation Timeline & KQL Queries

### 1. Detect ZIP Archive Activity
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "win10vm"
| where FileName endswith ".zip"
| order by Timestamp desc
```
**Repeated ZIP creation logs**

### 2. Trace the Process Behind Archive Creation
```kql
let VMName = "win10vm";
let specificTime = datetime(2025-04-14T00:50:11.5715803Z);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))
| where DeviceName == VMName
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, FolderPath
```
**PowerShell invoking 7z.exe**

### 3. Check for Exfiltration Evidence
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "win10vm"
| where FileName endswith ".zip"
| where RequestAccountName == "Cyberlab123"
| order by Timestamp desc 
//| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, PreviousFileName, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```
**No data exfiltration but evidence of potential Data-Staging**

## :shield: Conclusion
The user account `Cyberlab123` installed 7-Zip via PowerShell, created a ZIP archive of what appears to be employee data, and moved it to a hidden folder. Although no direct data exfiltration was observed, the behavior is strongly consistent with data staging and insider threat patterns.

---

## :bulb: Recommendations
- Enforce PowerShell script restrictions via AppLocker
- Block unauthorized archive utilities like 7-Zip
- Enable NSG outbound filtering on critical assets
- Implement Sentinel and Defender alerts for abnormal file handling

## :toolbox: Lab Process Summary
### 1. **Preparation**
- Hypothesis: A user may be staging data for exfiltration using PowerShell and compression tools.

### 2. **Data Collection**
- Collected logs from Defender tables (`DeviceFileEvents`, `DeviceProcessEvents`, `DeviceNetworkEvents`)

### 3. **Analysis**
- Discovered timed creation and renaming of archive files using suspicious processes

### 4. **Investigation**
- Identified the tools used, user account responsible, and mapped them to TTPs

### 5. **Response**
- Isolated VM, disabled account, deleted archives, and implemented alerts

### 6. **Documentation**
- Created detailed report with findings, screenshots, and mapped techniques

### 7. **Improvement**
- Hardened PowerShell controls, added NSG rules, and enhanced baseline detection with Sentinel
